# better pr

better pr is the fastest way to review pull requests.

## Development

Use `bun` for everything - package management, tests.

_NEVER_ use browser tools - they will not work with this project.

## Principles

- Performance is P1. If things feel laggy or are not smooth, it is of the utmost importance to fix. better pr exists because GitHub's PR review is slow.
- Tests should primarily occur at the data-layer, and the frontend should mostly dummily render the data.

## Testing

Tests should be minimal, not conflict with each other, and not be race-prone.

If you make changes to a file that has tests, you should ensure the tests pass and add a test-case if one does not already exist covering it.
We do not want duplicative tiny tests, but we want cases to be covered.

Good:

- `import { test } from "bun:test"`
- File being tested: "file-name.tsx" -> test name: "file-name.test.tsx"

Bad:

- `import { it } from "bun:test"`
- Any form of timing-based test (e.g. `setTimeout`, `setImmediate`, etc)
- Deep nesting of tests
- File being tested: "my-component.tsx" -> test name: "debug.test.tsx"

## Linting

Always run `bun typecheck` and `bun fmt` after changes to ensure that files are formatted and have no type errors.

## Debugging

If the user provides a PR identifier, you should use the `gh` CLI to inspect the API so we can fix our implementation if it appears incorrect.

## PR + Release Workflow

- Reuse existing PRs; never close or recreate without instruction. Force-push updates.
- After every push run:

```bash
gh pr view <number> --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus | jq '.'
./scripts/wait_pr_checks.sh <pr_number>
```

- Generally run `wait_pr_checks` after submitting a PR to ensure CI passes.
- Status decoding: `mergeable=MERGEABLE` clean; `CONFLICTING` needs resolution. `mergeStateStatus=CLEAN` ready, `BLOCKED` waiting for CI, `BEHIND` rebase, `DIRTY` conflicts.
- If behind: `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main && git push --force-with-lease`.
- Never enable auto-merge or merge at all unless the user explicitly says "merge it".
- PR descriptions: include only information a busy reviewer cannot infer; focus on implementation nuances or validation steps.
- Title prefixes: `perf|refactor|fix|feat|ci|bench`, e.g., `🤖 fix: handle workspace rename edge cases`.
