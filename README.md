Fast, filterable PR review. Entirely client-side.

> [!WARNING]
> Pulldash is WIP. Expect bugs.

## Try It

**Browser**: [pulldash.com](https://pulldash.com). Replace `github.com` with `pulldash.com` in any PR URL.

**Desktop**: [Latest release](https://github.com/coder/pulldash/releases) for Linux, macOS, Windows.

[![Example](./docs/screenshots/overview.png)](https://pulldash.com)

## Features

- **Custom filters**: Add repos and filter by review requests, authored PRs, or all activity.

  ![Filtering PRs](./docs/screenshots/filtering.png)

- **Keyboard-driven**: `j`/`k` to navigate files, arrows for lines, `c` to comment, `s` to submit.

  ![Keybinds](./docs/screenshots/keybind-driven.png)

- **Fast file search**: `Ctrl+K` to fuzzy-find across hundreds of changed files.

## Why

- GitHub's review UI is slow (especially for large diffs)
- No central view to filter PRs you care about
- AI tooling has produced more PRs than ever before—making a snappy review UI essential

## How It Works

GitHub's API supports [CORS](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/using-the-rest-api/using-cors-and-jsonp-to-make-cross-origin-requests), so Pulldash runs entirely client-side. No backend proxying your requests.

- **Web Worker pool**: Diff parsing and syntax highlighting run in workers sized to `navigator.hardwareConcurrency`. The main thread stays free for scrolling.

- **Pre-computed navigation**: When a diff loads, we index all navigable lines. Arrow keys are O(1)—no DOM queries.

- **External store**: State lives outside React ([`useSyncExternalStore`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useSyncExternalStore)). Focusing line 5000 doesn't re-render the file tree.

- **Virtualized rendering**: Diffs, file lists, and the command palette only render visible rows.

## Run Locally

Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tskimmett/pulldash.git
cd pulldash
bun install
bun start
```

Open http://pulldash.localhost:3002 (set `PORT` to change the port). Semantic review is available when [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) or Codex is logged in on your machine.

To update, `git pull && bun install && bun start`.

## Development

```bash
bun install
bun dev
```
